                <p>This work term report covers my experience as a co-op student at Tulip Retail. I spent the previous four months working at Tulip Retail and had a great experience. This internship took place over one co-op work term and was from May 2023 - August 2023.</p>

                <h3 class="contentHeading">ABOUT TULIP RETAIL</h3>

                <h3 class="contentHeading">WORK TERM GOALS</h3>
                <p>My three goals for this work term were to improve my problem-solving and debugging skills further, improve my collaboration and communication skills within a team of software developers, and gain a better understanding of how code testing works.</p>

                <div id="indent">
                    <h4 class="contentSubheading">IMPROVE MY PROBLEM-SOLVING AND DEBUGGING SKILLS</h4>
                    <p>When I started my internship, one of my primary goals was to level up my problem-solving and debugging abilities. I recognized that these skills are absolutely essential in the world of software development, where challenges and bugs are extremely common. As I tackled various tasks, I actively worked on improoving these skills. Whenever I encountered an issue, I saw it as a chance to learn. My approach was to break down the problem into smaller pieces, closely examine the code, and make good use of debugging tools. Over time, I was able to learn from my mistakes and take note of where i could improove. This lead to a slow and steady increase overtime. I can confidently say that my problem-solving and debugging skills are much better now than prior to my work term.</p>
    
                    <h4 class="contentSubheading">IMPROVE MY COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS WITHIN A TEAM OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS</h4>
                    <p>The second goal I had going into my work term was to improve my collaboration and communication skills within a team of software developers. I knew that teamwork and clear communication were super important in our line of work, so I wanted to level up in these areas. Additionally, having strong communication skills can save you time when working on tasks and prevent any issues that result from miscommunication. To achieve this, I made sure to be active in team activities and discussions. Whether we were brainstorming or having regular team meetings, I tried to speak up and listen to my teammates carefully. I learned a lot from the experienced developers on the team. They showed me that open and honest communication is key, and that giving and taking feedback helps the team grow.</p>

                    <h4 class="contentSubheading">GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CODE TESTING WORKS</h4>
                    <p>My final goal for my work term was to gain a better understanding of how code testing works. I knew this was a crucial part of software development, so I wanted to learn more about it. I actively participated in testing efforts for our projects, wrote test cases, and worked with my teammates to identify and fix issues. This hands-on experience helped me gain a much better understanding of how code testing works.</p>

                <p>Overall, these goals helped me to focus my efforts and ensure that I was making the most of my work term at Tulip Retail. By the end of my internship, I felt that I had made significant progress toward achieving these goals. I was well-prepared to continue my development as a software developer.</p>
