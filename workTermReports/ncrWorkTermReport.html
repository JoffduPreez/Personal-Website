                <p>This work term report outlines my internship experience at NCR Voyix, where I had the opportunity to contribute to significant software development and performance enhancement projects. Over the course of four months, from January to April 2024, I have been working a team that was instrumental in advancing the company's proprietary technologies. This experience provided me with tons of practical knowledge and a deeper understanding of software engineering in a large-scale environment.</p>

                <h3 class="contentHeading">WORK TERM GOALS</h3>
                <p>My three goals for this work term were to enhance my proficiency in modern development tools and technologies, work on the ability to evaluate software design and propose innovative solutions, and sharpen my personal organization skills and master time management to enhance productivity and meet project deadlines consistently.</p>

                <div id="indent">
                    <h4 class="contentSubheading">ENHANCE MY PROFICIENCY IN MODERN DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES</h4>
                    <p>When I started my internship, one of my primary goals was to level up my proficiency in modern development tools and technologies. Collaboration was a crucial element of my learning. Working closely with experienced developers, I really got into the hands-on side of software development. This enhanced my technical skills and made me better at working effectively within a team. The feedback from code reviews was especially helpful; it encouraged me to keep improving my methods and to try new ways of doing things that met industry standards. Measuring my success, I noticed significant progress in handling and delivering project tasks independently. The positive feedback from senior developers, acknowledging my contributions and improvements, really confirmed that I was doing well.</p>
    
                    <h4 class="contentSubheading">WORK ON THE ABILITY TO EVALUATE SOFTWARE DESIGN AND PROPOSE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS</h4>
                    <p>My second goal during my work term was to evaluate software design and propose innovative solutions. In past work, I have noticed that one of the main skills separating an experienced developer from an inexperienced one is the ability to analyze a problem and propose a helpful solution. I feel that increasing my ability to analyze problems and propose solutions is a helpful way to increase my general problem-solving skills, as it opens up the door for feedback from other developers regarding the usefulness of your proposed solutions. As I have progressed in my work term, I have felt more comfortable with engaging in code reviews and offering alternitave solutions to problems. Additionally, I have become much more independent when working on foreign tasks, which shows how my ability to analyze problems and propose solutions has grown.</p>

                    <h4 class="contentSubheading">SHARPEN MY PERSONAL ORGANIZATION SKILLS AND MASTER TIME MANAGEMENT</h4>
                    <p>Throughout my internship, improving my organization and time management skills was a key focus. I started each day by clearly setting out what needed to be done, which helped me tackle tasks systematically and prioritize effectively. Using the Pomodoro Technique allowed me to maintain a high focus and manage fatigue, significantly improving my productivity. The end-of-day reflections were extremely valuable; they helped me see what strategies worked best and where I could improve. This practice made my days more productive and helped me become more reflective and proactive about managing my workload.</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>Overall, these goals helped me to focus my efforts and ensure that I was making the most of my work term. By the end of April, I felt that I had made significant progress toward achieving these goals and was well-prepared to continue my development as a software developer.</p>
