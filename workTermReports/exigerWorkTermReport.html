                <p>This work term report covers my experience as a co-op student at Exiger. I spent the previous eight months working at Exiger and had a great experience. This internship took place over two co-op work terms and was from May 2022 - December 2022.</p>

                <h3 class="contentHeading">ABOUT EXIGER</h3>

                <h3 class="contentHeading">WORK TERM GOALS</h3>
                <p>My three goals for this work term were to improve my ability to program in Java, learn new development tools commonly used with projects, and learn better coding practices and how large-scale applications are kept organized.</p>

                <div id="indent">
                    <h4 class="contentSubheading">IMPROVE UPON MY ABILITY TO PROGRAM IN JAVA</h4>
                    <p>Improving my ability to program in Java was the goal I focused on most during my work term, and this goal related the most to my job tasks. Java was the only language I used as a software developer Intern at Exiger. As a software developer intern, I knew that proficiency in Java would be essential for my job tasks, and I wanted to ensure that I was comfortable with the language.</p>
    
                    <h4 class="contentSubheading">LEARN NEW DEVELOPMENT TOOLS THAT ARE COMMONLY USED WITH PROJECTS</h4>
                    <p>The second goal I had going into my work term was to learn new development tools commonly used in projects. I knew that many different tools and technologies were available for software development, and I wanted to ensure that I was familiar with the ones most commonly used in the industry. The different development tools I have learned about and expanded my learning are Docker, Maven, HashiCorp Vault, OpenAPI Specification, Swagger, IntelliJ IDE, and Git. Understanding these new development skills taught me a lot about how to research new technologies effectively.</p>
                    <h4 class="contentSubheading">LEARN BETTER CODING PRACTICES AND HOW LARGE-SCALE APPLICATIONS ARE KEPT ORGANIZED</h4>
                    <p>My final goal for my work term was to learn better coding practices and how large-scale applications are kept organized. I knew that being able to write clean and efficient code was essential for any software developer, and I wanted to make sure that I was following best practices in this regard. I also learned a lot about the development process for creating new features and how the software Jira is used to track progress, which relates to the organization of large-scale applications.</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>Overall, these goals helped me to focus my efforts and ensure that I was making the most of my work term at Exiger. By the end of my internship, I felt that I had made significant progress toward achieving these goals. I was well-prepared to continue my development as a software developer.</p>

                <h3 class="contentHeading">DESCRIPTION OF MY JOB</h3>
                <p>I spent my eight months at Exiger working on various projects that ranged in size and difficulty. The most interesting project I worked on at Exiger was exploring ways to rotate IP addresses using proxy servers to effectively scrape web data. IP rotation using proxy servers was a new concept for me, and I found it fascinating. The core skills required from me at Exiger I learned in class. However, there were multiple instances where I had to learn new skills on the fly.</p>

                <h4 class="contentSubheading">PROJECTS I WORKED ON AT EXIGER:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set up automated documentation for 123 API endpoints using Swagger OpenAPI Specification</li>
                    <li>Connected Swagger OpenAPI Specification with a UI to produce an interactive form of documentation</li>
                    <li>Integrated HashiCorp Vault into a project to secure and encrypt start-up credentials</li>
                    <li>Explored ways to rotate IP addresses using proxy servers to effectively scrape web data</li>
                    <li>Worked on converting a project into a spring boot application</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="contentHeading">RELATION TO ACADEMIC STUDIES</h3>
                <p>My co-op experience at Exiger developed many new skills that relate to my academic studies. I now have a significantly better understanding of how to code in Java. I can also use Git with much more confidence than before. Finally, I am much better at working with a team, which will aid me in any group projects I have in the future.</p>
                
                <h3 class="contentHeading">CONCLUSION</h3>
                <p>After completing my work term with Exiger, the skills I increased the most are my ability to program in Java and learning a bunch of small skills that will come in handy as a software developer in the future.</p>

                <h3 class="contentHeading">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h3>
                <p>I would like to thank Exiger for giving me the opportunity to complete my 8-month co-op with them. I would also like to thank the DDIQ-Core team that I worked with and my manager Stefan for all being extremely helpful and kind over the course of my work term.</p>
